- ROM changes
    - wally zigzagoon
    - birch zigzagoon
    - [?] Winona bug (in opt)

- individual mon
    - [P1] regularizer on embedding dimensions and/or sample from mean/var of learned embeddings instead of normal
    - [P4] generate icon files from embedding
    - [P4] generate large front / back sprites from icons (trained once)

- evolution network
    - [P1] make coherent outputs by tuning various hyperparams

- replacement
    - [P0] generate mon from networks and replace data in ROM files along the way
    - [P1] create mon maps from original mon to generated mon to get coherent game mapping
